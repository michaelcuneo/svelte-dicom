Svelte-Dicom evening project, based on Reddit comment. [text](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1m0mlav/comment/n3b7n8g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I like a challenge, to keep myself entertained of an evening after the 9-5... this medical tool pairs well with my research projects at The University of Newcastle... so here goes nothing,... or something. DICOM imaging tool for SvelteKit on the way.

## Installation

```bash
# install the repo.
npm i @michaelcuneo/svelte-dicom
```

## Usage

```bash
# not sure yet... still developing the canvas renderer.
```

## Todo

- Decode/Encode for Uncompressed, Lossless, Lossy and RLE.
- Sync/Async Dictionary Loading.
- Fix image controls.
- Apply networking implementations for PACS
